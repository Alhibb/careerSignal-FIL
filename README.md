## 📖 Overview

**CareerSignal On-Chain** is a decentralized protocol that empowers professionals to build a sovereign, verifiable record of their career achievements. By leveraging the Filecoin network and the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), we provide the tools to create immutable, transparent, and user-owned proofs of work history, skills, and credentials.

This platform eliminates dependence on centralized services like LinkedIn, giving individuals true ownership of their professional identity and enabling a new layer of trust for recruiters, DAOs, and the entire Web3 ecosystem.

## 🎯 The Problem

In today's digital world, our professional identity is fragmented and controlled by third-party platforms.
*   **Centralized Control:** Platforms can censor, alter, or revoke access to your data at any time.
*   **Lack of Verifiability:** It's difficult to prove that a credential or skill listed on a profile is authentic.
*   **Data Silos:** Career history is locked into specific platforms, making it hard to build a universal, interoperable resume.
*   **Inefficiency for Web3:** DAOs and decentralized companies lack trust-minimized tools to vet talent and verify contributions.

## ✨ The Solution

CareerSignal On-Chain solves this by moving professional identity onto a decentralized, user-owned foundation.

*   **Verifiable Credentials:** Smart contracts on the FVM allow for the minting of career milestones (certificates, project completions, skill endorsements) as on-chain assets (NFTs).
*   **Decentralized & Persistent Storage:** All associated portfolio data (project files, certificate PDFs, resumes) is stored immutably on **Filecoin** via **IPFS**, ensuring it remains accessible and tamper-proof for the long term.
*   **Developer-First Ecosystem:** A robust **SDK and API** will allow any dApp, job board, or DAO to seamlessly integrate CareerSignal's verification features, enriching the entire Filecoin developer ecosystem.

## 🚀 Core Features

*   **🎓 On-Chain Credential Minting:** Educational institutions, employers, or platforms can issue verifiable credentials directly to a user's wallet.
*   **💼 Decentralized Portfolio:** Users can upload and manage a rich portfolio of their work, with all files securely stored on Filecoin.
*   **🛠️ Developer SDK/API:** A simple-to-use toolkit for developers to read, verify, and display CareerSignal data in their own applications.
*   **🤝 True Data Ownership:** Users have ultimate control over their data, deciding what to share and with whom.

## 🏛️ Project Status

> ⚠️ **This project is currently in the pre-development phase.**
>
> This repository has been set up in preparation for the work proposed under the **FIL Builder Next Step Grant** program by the Filecoin Foundation. The codebase will be actively developed and pushed here upon the successful approval of our grant proposal. We believe in building in the open and are excited to share our progress with the community soon!

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

Our initial development is focused on delivering a powerful MVP within 30 days, as outlined in our grant proposal.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Smart Contracts & FVM Integration**
  - [ ] Design and develop FVM contracts for credential minting and verification.
  - [ ] Deploy contracts to the Calibration testnet for initial testing.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Decentralized Storage Workflows**
  - [ ] Implement file upload and retrieval logic using IPFS and Filecoin.
  - [ ] Connect storage workflows to the on-chain credential system.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Developer SDK & API**
  - [ ] Build the core modules for a developer SDK to read and verify on-chain data.
  - [ ] Create initial API endpoints for easy integration.

- [ ] **Phase 4: MVP Launch & Documentation**
  - [ ] Deploy a working MVP web application.
  - [ ] Deploy all contracts to Filecoin Mainnet.
  - [ ] Publish a complete open-source repository, a demo video, and comprehensive technical documentation.
